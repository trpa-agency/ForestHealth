    "This code defines a function, `assess_density_targets`, that evaluates whether each pixel in a set of forest raster datasets meets specific stand density and basal area thresholds, based on forest type and seral stage. The function uses a dictionary called `thresholds` to store the minimum required values for stand density (stems per acre) and basal area (square feet per acre) for each combination of forest type and seral stage. For example, Jeffrey Pine in the early seral stage must have less than 200 stems per acre and 30 square feet of basal area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function initializes an output raster where all pixels are set to -1, indicating \"not classified.\" It then iterates through each forest type and seral stage combination in the thresholds dictionary. For each combination, it uses logical conditions to identify pixels that both match the forest type and seral stage and meet or exceed the required thresholds (\"meets\"). These pixels are assigned a value of 1 in the output raster. Pixels that match the forest type and seral stage but fail to meet at least one threshold (\"fails\") are assigned a value of 0. The function uses the `Con` tool from ArcPy to perform these conditional assignments efficiently across the raster.\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining the function, the code loads four rasters: forest type, seral stage, stand density, and basal area. The forest type raster is created by reclassifying the vegetation type raster using a separate function, `build_forest_type_raster`. The assessment function is then called to generate a new raster, where each pixel is classified as 1 (meets both targets), 0 (fails at least one target), or -1 (not classified). This workflow allows for spatially explicit evaluation of forest stand conditions against threshold targets."

    "This code performs a classification and tabulation of forest seral stages by combining information from three raster datasets: forest type, seral stage, and canopy cover. The main function, `classify_seral_stage`, first prepares the canopy cover raster by filling any null values with zero. It then creates a binary canopy class: for most forest types, pixels with canopy cover ≥50% are considered \"closed canopy,\" but for Jeffrey Pine (forest type code 1), the threshold is lowered to 40%. This logic ensures that the canopy classification is tailored to the ecological characteristics of each forest type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the function combines the seral stage and canopy class rasters into a single raster (`combined_class_r`) that encodes five possible seral stage classes: early, mid (closed canopy), mid (open canopy), late (open canopy), and late (closed canopy). This is achieved using nested `Con` statements, which assign a unique class code based on the combination of seral stage and canopy closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TabulateArea` tool is then used to summarize the area of each seral stage class within each forest type, producing a table where each row represents a forest type and each column represents a seral stage class. The function reads this table, calculates the area in both square meters and acres, and computes the percentage of each seral stage class within each forest type. It then compares these percentages to user-defined \"desired conditions\" (target percentage ranges for each class and forest type) and classifies each result as \"on target,\" \"below target,\" or \"above target.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the results are organized into a pandas DataFrame with descriptive labels for forest type and seral stage, and the DataFrame is saved as a CSV file. This workflow provides a clear, quantitative assessment of how current forest conditions compare to threshold targets."

    "This code provides a workflow for classifying and analyzing fire severity across a landscape using raster data. The first part defines a function, `dominant_fire_severity`, which determines the dominant fire severity class for each pixel by comparing three input rasters: high, moderate, and low fire probability. It uses the `Con` function to assign a value of 1 if the low severity probability is highest, 2 if moderate is highest, and 3 otherwise (implying high severity dominates). The result is converted to an integer raster and saved to disk. The function also builds an attribute table for the output raster and adds an \"Acres\" field, which is calculated for each class, then saves the updated raster again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second function, `identify_fire_severity`, overlays the dominant fire severity raster with management zones. It first converts the raster to polygons, adds and calculates an \"Acres\" field for each polygon, and then performs an identity analysis to spatially join the polygons with management zone features. The result is a new feature class that contains both the dominant fire severity class and the management zone information, with acreage recalculated for the output. This workflow enables spatial analysis of fire severity patterns in relation to management areas, supporting landscape-level fire and resource planning."
